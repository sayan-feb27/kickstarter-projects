# KickStarter Projects


A pet project with django-ninja.
Data source is downloaded from [Kaggle Kickstarter Projects](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/kickstarter-projects).

I want to compare django-ninja vs FastAPI.

----
IMHO I feel like django-ninja overall is better choice than FastAPI.
