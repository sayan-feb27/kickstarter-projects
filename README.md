# KickStarter Projects


A pet project with django-ninja.
Data source is downloaded from [Kaggle Kickstarter Projects](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/kickstarter-projects).

I want to compare django-ninja vs FastAPI.


### TODO:
- [x] Properly setup the django project.
- [x] Create a model named "Project".
- [ ] Load data from a file.
- [ ] Add CRUD endpoints (async).
  - [ ] Create.
  - [ ] Read.
  - [ ] Update.
  - [ ] Delete.
- [ ] Docker.
- [ ] Unit tests.
- [ ] UI? React, Vue, Angular?
- [ ] Deploy?
